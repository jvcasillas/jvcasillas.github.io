In the remixed version of the song "despacito", Justin Bieber sings in Spanish. 
Some articles online criticize his pronunciation. I analyzed his realization of 
"p" and "t" in Praat and find that, while his pronunciation is not perfect, it is 
pretty good. I don't believe he commits the "errors" suggested in the article.

### Overview

I recently heard the song ```despacito``` featuring teen hero Justin Bieber (my wife 
mentioned to me that he sings in Spanish and my curiosity got the best of me). 
I distinctly remember being rather impressed by how well he sang in Spanish, so I was 
surprised when I saw [this](http://remezcla.com/music/j-balvin-nicky-jam-despacito-remix/)
article pop up in my facebook feed. Basically, J Balvin and Nicky Jam (I have 
no idea who these guys are) make fun of J Biebs accent. Specifically, they 
harp on his pronunciation of the title of the song, suggesting the /t/ in the 
diminutive form of "despacio" (slow) is realized as [ɹ]. In fact, they sing it 
a few times [des.pa.si.ɹo] (des-pa-see-row, if you aren't familiar with IPA) and, 
in jest, claim at one point that he sings 'dorito' [ðo.ɹi.ɾo]. You can watch this 
specific part here:

 </div>
</div>
</br>

Now, this type of non-native pronunciation actually makes a lot of sense, at least 
I think the 'dorito' comment does. In American and Canadian English an intervocalic 
"t" (and "d") is usually pronounced as a flap, which in essence corresponds with 
Spanish "r" in the same position (note: it has to be in the same position, otherwise 
it would pronounced as a trill). This leads to all kinds of difficulties for learners 
of Spanish because they have to avoid a phonological process of their native language. 
For example, a common mispronunciation of the Spanish word "todo" (all) is [to.ɾo], 
which actually means "toro" (bull). That is, English speakers (mis)pronounce the 
intervocalic /d/ as a flap, which is most perceptually similar to Spanish "r". On the 
other hand, when they try to pronounce "toro", the "r" is realized as the English rhotic 
[ɹ].

Thus, if Bieber were pronouncing /ito/ as most native English speakers do, as a flap, 
it would be perceived as a Spanish "r" (the flap, not the trill). However, there is no 
real explanation for why he would pronounce it with an English rhotic ([ɹ]) as J Balvin 
and Nicky Jam claim. I personally did not hear this pronunciation, so I assume they were 
just teasing the teenage heart throb. Nonetheless, I noticed a lot of comments in the 
article were also making fun of his pronunciation, so I decided I would take a look in 
praat to determine if I am going crazy or if the internet is just full of haters. Here 
is an example of what we will look at:

### The analysis

I downloaded the music video from youtube and converted the .mp4 file to .m4a, and then 
to .wav. In praat I converted the .wav from stereo to mono. Justin sings the chorus as well 
as some of the verses. I'm just going to look at the chorus because the verses are accompanied 
by Daddy Yankee and/or Luis Fonsi. Luckily, pretty much every time he says "despacito" in the 
chorus there is silence, so we can use that for our analysis. I am going to focus on how he 
pronounces the stop /t/ (though I did get formant frequency measurements for all the vowels... 
maybe for another post). This only leaves us with about 5 useful tokens, but there are also a 
good amount of /p/'s that we can compare them with. Here is arguably the best token:

<div align="center">
  <img src="./figs/despacito.png">
</div>

It's clear---at least to me---that Justin is not producing an English rhotic where he should 
be producing [t]. In other words, he is *not* saying des-pa-see-row. How do I know? Well, 
if we zoom in on the final /ito/, we notice two things: 1) there is clearly a closure and 
2) there is a burst. These are characteristics of a stop consonant. Now, you might be thinking 
"Yeah, but a flap looks pretty similar in a spectrogram" and you wouldn't be wrong, but the 
clear difference here is that after the release there is a short gap before the voicing of the 
final /o/. This short gap is called voice-onset time (VOT). Stops have VOT; flaps do not. Here 
is a close up:

<div align="center">
  <img src="./figs/ito.png">
</div>

Now a characteristic of English voiceless stops ("p", "t", "k") is that in word initial position 
they are produced with aspiration and have long-lag VOT, usually around 60 ms. We refer to them 
with IPA with: [p^h^, t^h^, k^h^]. Voiceless stops are different in Spanish, as they are not aspirated 
and have short-lag VOT, usually from 0 to 25 ms. The "ito" of "despacito" is word internal, thus, 
in theory, for an English speaker it should not be aspirated because it is normally realized as a flap, though in emphatic 
speech it could be realized as [t^h^]. Hopefully I have already convinced you that Biebs is not 
flapping. So our next question is: what kind of VOT do his stops have? If they are short-lag, we can 
conclude that they are more Spanish-like. If, on the other hand, they are aspirated, then they 
would be more English-like. So let's take a look! 

I measured VOT of every p and t every time Justin sings "despacito". First, let's load some packages 
we will need.  

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(lingStuff); library(tidyverse)
```

Now we can load the data and check the structure.  

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Load data
bieber_vot <- read_csv("./data/despacito.csv")
```

```{r, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

# Check structure of dataframe
bieber_vot %>%

  gather(., key = phon, value = vot, -prefix) %>%

```

Looks good. Let's plot the VOT of the p's and t's and see how they look. I've 
set the x-limit to range from 0 to 60. 

```{r, fig.retina=2, fig.height=4, fig.width=8, fig.align='center', eval=FALSE}
# Plot vot as a function of phon
bieber_vot %>%
  select(., prefix, votP, votT) %>%
  gather(., key = phon, value = vot, -prefix) %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = phon, y = vot, color = phon)) + 
    stat_summary(fun.data = 'mean_cl_boot', geom = 'pointrange', size = 1.1) +
    stat_summary(fun.y = 'mean', geom = 'point', color = 'darkred', size = 2.75) +
    ylim(0, 60) + ylab("VOT (ms)") + xlab("") + 
    scale_x_discrete(labels = c('/p/', '/t/')) + 
    coord_flip() + 
    scale_color_brewer(name = '', guide = F) + 
    theme_dark(base_size = 22, base_family = "Times")
```

<img width="100%" src="./figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png">


```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
bieber_means <- bieber_vot %>%
  select(., prefix, votP, votT) %>%
  gather(., key = phon, value = vot, -prefix) %>%
  group_by(phon) %>%
  summarise(., mean = mean(vot), sd = sd(vot))
```


Recall that an English-like VOT would be around 60 ms (but could range from around 
40 to over 100!). We can see that the p's have a VOT of approximately 20 ms 
(`r round(bieber_means[1, 2], 2)` ms +/- `r round(bieber_means[1, 3], 2)` sd, to be 
exact), and the t's have a VOT of around 25 ms (`r round(bieber_means[2, 2], 2)` ms 
+/- `r round(bieber_means[2, 3], 2)` sd). Both are certainly within range of native 
Spanish pronunciations.

### Not so fast...

There is one last thing to keep in mind before we give JBiebs a pass on his Spanish and 
it's an important one. Spanish /t/ and English /t/ are articulated at different places in 
the mouth. Specifically, Spanish /t/ is dental and English /t/ is alveolar. What this means 
is that when an English speaker pronounces a word with a "t" in Spanish, like 'despacito', 
she also needs to change the place of articulation, i.e. the tongue needs to make contact 
with the back of the top teeth, and not the hard ridge right above them. When we looked at 
VOT in the present analysis we didn't take this difference into account. My personal opinion is 
that el señorito does a pretty good job, but if you listen closely to the very last 'despacito' 
in the song, it does sound rather alveolar, i.e. gringo-y.
