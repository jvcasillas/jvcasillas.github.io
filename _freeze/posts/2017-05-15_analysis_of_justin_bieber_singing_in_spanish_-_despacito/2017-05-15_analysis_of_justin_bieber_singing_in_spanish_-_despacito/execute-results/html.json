I analyzed his realization of \"p\" and \"t\" in Praat and find that, while his pronunciation is not perfect, it is pretty good. \nI don't believe he commits the \"errors\" suggested in the article.\n\n### Overview\n\nI recently heard the song `despacito` featuring teen hero Justin Bieber (my wife mentioned to me that he sings in Spanish and my curiosity got the best of me). \nI distinctly remember being rather impressed by how well he sang in Spanish, so I was surprised when I saw [this](http://remezcla.com/music/j-balvin-nicky-jam-despacito-remix/) article pop up in my facebook feed. \nBasically, J Balvin and Nicky Jam (I have no idea who these guys are) make fun of J Biebs accent. \nSpecifically, they harp on his pronunciation of the title of the song, suggesting the /t/ in the diminutive form of \"despacio\" (slow) is realized as [ɹ]. \nIn fact, they sing it a few times [des.pa.si.ɹo] (des-pa-see-row, if you aren't familiar with IPA) and, in jest, claim at one point that he sings 'dorito' [ðo.ɹi.ɾo]. \nYou can watch this specific part here:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n <div class=\"video-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jtCScBRaX9k?ecver=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n </div>\n</div>\n</br>\n\nNow, this type of non-native pronunciation actually makes a lot of sense, at least I think the 'dorito' comment does. \nIn American and Canadian English an intervocalic \"t\" (and \"d\") is usually pronounced as a flap, which in essence corresponds with Spanish \"r\" in the same position (note: it has to be in the same position, otherwise \nit would pronounced as a trill). \nThis leads to all kinds of difficulties for learners of Spanish because they have to avoid a phonological process of their native language. \nFor example, a common mispronunciation of the Spanish word \"todo\" (all) is [to.ɾo], which actually means \"toro\" (bull). \nThat is, English speakers (mis)pronounce the intervocalic /d/ as a flap, which is most perceptually similar to Spanish \"r\". \nOn the other hand, when they try to pronounce \"toro\", the \"r\" is realized as the English rhotic [ɹ].\n\nThus, if Bieber were pronouncing /ito/ as most native English speakers do, as a flap, it would be perceived as a Spanish \"r\" (the flap, not the trill). However, there is no real explanation for why he would pronounce it with an English rhotic ([ɹ]) as J Balvin and Nicky Jam claim. \nI personally did not hear this pronunciation, so I assume they were just teasing the teenage heart throb. \nNonetheless, I noticed a lot of comments in the article were also making fun of his pronunciation, so I decided I would take a look in praat to determine if I am going crazy or if the internet is just full of haters. \nHere is an example of what we will look at:\n\n</br>\n<div align=\"center\">\n<audio controls>\n   <source src=\"./assets/wavs/segmented/despacito.wav\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n Your browser does not support the audio element.\n</audio>\n</div> \n</br>\n\n\n### The analysis\n\nI downloaded the music video from youtube and converted the .mp4 file to .m4a, and then to .wav. \nIn praat I converted the .wav from stereo to mono. \nJustin sings the chorus as well as some of the verses. \nI'm just going to look at the chorus because the verses are accompanied by Daddy Yankee and/or Luis Fonsi. \nLuckily, pretty much every time he says \"despacito\" in the chorus there is silence, so we can use that for our analysis. \nI am going to focus on how he pronounces the stop /t/ (though I did get formant frequency measurements for all the vowels... maybe for another post). \nThis only leaves us with about 5 useful tokens, but there are also a good amount of /p/'s that we can compare them with. \nHere is arguably the best token:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"./assets/figs/despacito.png\">\n</div>\n\nIt's clear---at least to me---that Justin is not producing an English rhotic where he should be producing [t]. \nIn other words, he is *not* saying des-pa-see-row. \nHow do I know? \nWell, if we zoom in on the final /ito/, we notice two things: 1) there is clearly a closure and 2) there is a burst. \nThese are characteristics of a stop consonant. \nNow, you might be thinking \"Yeah, but a flap looks pretty similar in a spectrogram\" and you wouldn't be wrong, but the clear difference here is that after the release there is a short gap before the voicing of the final /o/. \nThis short gap is called voice-onset time (VOT). \nStops have VOT; flaps do not. \nHere is a close up:\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"./assets/figs/ito.png\">\n</div>\n\nNow a characteristic of English voiceless stops (\"p\", \"t\", \"k\") is that in word initial position they are produced with aspiration and have long-lag VOT, usually around 60 ms. \nWe refer to them in IPA with: [p^h^, t^h^, k^h^]. \nVoiceless stops are different in Spanish, as they are not aspirated and have short-lag VOT, usually from 0 to 25 ms. \nThe \"ito\" of \"despacito\" is word internal, thus, in theory, for an English speaker it should not be aspirated because it is normally realized as a flap, though in emphatic speech it could be realized as [t^h^]. \nHopefully I have already convinced you that Biebs is not flapping. \nSo our next question is: what kind of VOT do his stops have? \nIf they are short-lag, we can conclude that they are more Spanish-like. \nIf, on the other hand, they are aspirated, then they would be more English-like. \nSo let's take a look! \n\nI measured VOT of every p and t every time Justin sings \"despacito\". \nFirst, let's load some packages we will need.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(lingStuff)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we can load the data and check the structure.  \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load data\nbieber_vot <- read_csv(\"./assets/data/despacito.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Check structure of dataframe\nbieber_vot %>%\n  select(., prefix, votP, votT) %>%\n  gather(., key = phon, value = vot, -prefix) %>%\n  str(.)\n## tibble [10 × 3] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n##  $ prefix: chr [1:10] \"despacito\" \"despacito1\" \"despacito2\" \"despacito3\" ...\n##  $ phon  : chr [1:10] \"votP\" \"votP\" \"votP\" \"votP\" ...\n##  $ vot   : num [1:10] 23.3 19.2 19 19.4 15.6 ...\n```\n:::\n\n\nLooks good. \nLet's plot the VOT of the p's and t's and see how they look. \nI've set the x-limit to range from 0 to 60. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Plot vot as a function of phon\nbieber_vot %>%\n  select(., prefix, votP, votT) %>%\n  gather(., key = phon, value = vot, -prefix) %>%\n  ggplot(., aes(x = phon, y = vot, color = phon)) + \n    stat_summary(fun.data = 'mean_cl_boot', geom = 'pointrange', size = 1.1) +\n    stat_summary(fun.y = 'mean', geom = 'point', color = 'darkred', size = 2.75) +\n    ylim(0, 60) + ylab(\"VOT (ms)\") + xlab(\"\") + \n    scale_x_discrete(labels = c('/p/', '/t/')) + \n    coord_flip() + \n    scale_color_brewer(name = '', guide = F) + \n    theme_dark(base_size = 22, base_family = \"Times\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n<img width=\"100%\" src=\"./assets/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png\">\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nRecall that an English-like VOT would be around 60 ms (but could range from around 40 to over 100!). \nWe can see that the p's have a VOT of approximately 20 ms (19.29 ms &pm; 2.72 sd, to be exact), and the t's have a VOT of around 25 ms (23.1 ms &pm; 7.39 sd). \nBoth are certainly within range of native Spanish pronunciations.\n\n\n<grey>Interim conclusion</grey>: <blue>the internet is full of haters</blue>.\n\n</br>\n\n### Not so fast...\n\nThere is one last thing to keep in mind before we give JBiebs a pass on his Spanish and it's an important one. \nSpanish /t/ and English /t/ are articulated at different places in the mouth. \nSpecifically, Spanish /t/ is dental and English /t/ is alveolar. \nWhat this means is that when an English speaker pronounces a word with a \"t\" in Spanish, like 'despacito', she also needs to change the place of articulation, i.e. the tongue needs to make contact with the back of the top teeth, and not the hard ridge right above them. \nWhen we looked at VOT in the present analysis we didn't take this difference into account. \nMy personal opinion is that el señorito does a pretty good job, but if you listen closely to the very last 'despacito' in the song, it does sound rather alveolar, i.e. gringo-y.  \n\n<grey>Conclusion</grey>: <blue>the internet is full of haters</blue>.\n\n\n\n\n<style type=\"text/css\">\n\nblue {\n    color: #0000CC;\n    font-weight: normal;\n    font-size: 20px;\n}\n\ngrey {\n    color: #515151;\n    font-size: 22px;\n    font-weight: normal;\n}\n\n.video-container {\n    position: relative;\n    padding-bottom: 50%;\n    padding-top: 35px;\n    height: 0;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    width: 70%;\n}\n\n.video-container iframe {\n    position: center;\n    top:0;\n    left: 0;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 100%;\n}\n\n</style>\n",
