You need to load the package phonTools into R.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(phonTools)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow you have to load the sound you want to make a spectrogram of (it has to be in your working directory). I recorded mine in Praat.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsound <- loadsound('welcome.wav')\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we're ready to make a spectrogram.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nspectrogram(sound, fs = 44100, colors = TRUE, \n            maintitle = \"Welcome\", maxfreq = 5500)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./assets/img/spectrogram.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\nWe can also see the oscillogram by using\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(sound)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./assets/img/waveform.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat's it. \n\n",
