Casillas \n    url: https://www.jvcasillas.com\n    affiliation: Rutgers University\n    affiliation_url: https://www.rutgers.edu\nbase_url: http://www.jvcasillas.com\ncategories: [r, latex, tikz]\ntwitter:\n  creator: \"@jvcasill\"\nengine: knitr\nimage: \"./assets/img/tikz_workflow.png\"\n---\n\n\n\n#### Overview\n\nThis mini tutorial is part II about incorporating `tikzDevice` into your workflow. \nIt explains the file structure necessary to successfully include `tikzDevice` plots into your $\\LaTeX$ document. \nYou must first have `tikzDevice` installed. \nIf you don't, see [part I][part I] for more information.\n\n#### The structure\n\nA simple yet effective way to do reproducible research is to use [R][R] (for statistical analysis) directly in a $\\LaTeX$ environment. \nThere are two ways to accomplish this: (1) Sweave and (2) [knitr][knitr]. \n`knitr` seems to be the better choice, as it builds on some of the deficiencies of Sweave, and is what I am currently using in my workflow. \nIn order to successfully \"knit\" R code into a .tex format we must use a no-web (.nw) file to create the .tex file. \nThere are two types of no-web files: .Rnw and .Snw. \nI am not completely sure what the differences are between then, but I use .Rnw and that is what I will mention in this tutorial.\n\nThe first step is to create a project folder. \nFor the purposes of this tutorial let's call this folder \"master\". \nNext, we will need some data and some R code that analyzes it. \nThe most common, no-hassle way to accomplish this in R is to save your R code in a separate .R file. \nFor this tutorial, we will call our data \"my-data.txt\" and our R code \"example.R\". \nThe fake data we are going to analyze is for a two-alternative forced choice identification experiment. \nSo, our fake data is in the \"my-data.txt\" file and the R code that analyzes it is in the example.R file.\n\nThe next step is to create the \"no web\" .Rnw file. \nThis is as simple as creating a document in your text editor of choice (I use [TextMate 2][tm2] and [Sublime Text 3][st3]) and saving it with a .Rnw extension. \nFor this tutorial we will call this file \"example.Rnw\". \nIts purpose is to call the R code written in \"example.R\" (which uses the fake data in \"my-data.txt\") in order to produce a .tex file (in this case \"example.tex\"). \nStill with me? Good.\n\nNext we need to prepare where we are going to keep the plots produced by tikzDevice. \nI find it most convenient to have a specific folder, \"plots\\_folder\", where I only keep the tikzDevice plots. \nSo, create this folder inside the \"master\" folder. \n`tikzDevice` creates the R plots and converts them to a $\\LaTeX$ format (the benefits of this are further explained in part III of this tutorial), saves them in \"plots\\_folder\" and we will then include them in the example.tex file which can be compiled into a PDF. \nThe image below shows what this should look like when it's all said and done.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](./assets/img/tikz_workflow.png){width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCheck out [part III][part III] to learn how to create standalone plots that can include IPA sybols.\n\n\n[part I]: /blog/2013-05-11_tikz_-_installation/index.html\n[part III]: /blog/2014-05-28_tikz_-_standalone_plots/index.html\n[R]: http://www.r-project.org\n[knitr]: http://yihui.name/knitr/\n[tm2]: https://github.com/textmate/textmate\n[st3]: http://www.sublimetext.com\n\n",
