My main interests are in phonetics, laboratory phonology, and second language acquisition. A principle aim of my research is to better understand the relationship between language use and sound representation in the mind, as well as the structure of sound systems in human languages. Most of my research is conducted on bilinguals of varying proficiency and linguistic experience. Some of my recent projects have focused on native phonetic experience and its influence on L2 speech production, perception and lexical processing. Though my main passions are centered around coding, statistical analysis, data visualization, and reproducible research, I also enjoy playing music, Casio watches and anything related to el andalú.\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            Interests\n            Phonetics/Phonology\n            Speech production, perception,spoken-word recognition\n            Second language acquisition\n            Bilingualism\n            Statistics/Data visualization\n            \n            \n            Education\n            \n            PhD in Spanish Linguistics, 2016 University of Arizona\n            \n            \n            MA in Spanish Linguistics, 2012 University of Arizona\n            \n            \n            BA in Psychology, 2006 Western Washington University\n            \n            \n            \n            \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n            \n              Joseph V.

You can find more information here: https://RAP-group.github.io. My main interests are in phonetics, laboratory phonology, and second language acquisition. A principle aim of my research is to better understand the relationship between language use and sound representation in the mind, as well as the structure of sound systems in human languages. Most of my research is conducted on bilinguals of varying proficiency and linguistic experience. Feel free to explore the tabs on this page if you are interested in knowing more about my research projects.\n\nProjects\nCurrent projects\nLongitudinal development of fine-phonetic detail in late learners (Info)\n\n\nThis ongoing project explores L2 category formation and the relationship between speech production and speech perception during the early stages of L2 acquisition. The data were/are collected in a stateside immersion program over the course of a summer. The participants complete a variety of tasks aimed at analyzing their acquisition of various L2 segments, such as: stops, trills, laterals and vowels.\n\n\nLanguage-specific perceptual normalization in adult L2 acquisition (Info)\n\n\nThis project explores a long history of ‘language set’ experiments with the goal of furthering our understanding of how bilinguals deal with the lack of invariance in the speech signal, both between and within languages. The project has implications for category formation and the development of bilingual language modes. (with Miquel Simonet)\n\n\nProduction/perception of English/Spanish coronal stops (Info)\n\n\nThis project has explored the acoustic characteristics of coronal stops in Spanish and English (link), the effects of stress on VOT in the Spanish/English monolinguals and bilinguals (link), as well as acoustic evidence for language-specific places of articulation (in preparation). (with Miquel Simonet and Yamile Díaz)\n\n\nSemantic predictability and speech rate effects in second language speech categorization (Info)\n\n\nMore info coming soon.

The present study uses meta-analytic techniques and coronal stop data from early bilinguals in order to assess this claim. The goal was to evaluate the cumulative evidence for “compromise” voice-onset time (VOT) in the speech of early bilinguals by providing a comprehensive assessment of the literature and presenting an acoustic analysis of coronal stops from early Spanish–English bilinguals. The studies were coded for linguistic and methodological features, as well as effect sizes, and then analyzed using a cross-classified Bayesian meta-analysis. The pooled effect for “compromise” VOT was negligible (β = −0.13). The acoustic analysis of the coronal stop data showed that the early Spanish–English bilinguals often produced Spanish and English targets with mismatched features from their other language. These performance mismatches presumably occurred as a result of interlingual interactions elicited by the experimental task. Taken together, the results suggest that early bilinguals do not have “compromise” VOT, though their speech involves dynamic phonetic interactions that can surface as performance mismatches during speech production.\n\n\n\n\n@Article{casillas_perfomance_mismatches_2021,\n  author = {Joseph Vicent Casillas},\n  title = {Interlingual Interactions Elicit Performance Mismatches Not \n    {'Compromise'} Categories in Early Bilinguals: {E}vidence from Meta-Analysis \n    and Coronal Stops},\n  year = {2021},\n  journal = {Languages},\n  volume = {6},\n  number = {9},\n  pages = {1--20},\n  doi = {https://doi.org/10.3390/languages6010009},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLozano-Argüelles, C., L.

Following Gonzales et al. (2019), we replicate the double phonemic boundary effect in late learners (LBs) using conceptual-based cueing. We administered a forced choice identification task to 169 native English adult learners of Spanish in two sessions. In both sessions, participants identified the same /b/-/p/ voicing continuum, but language context was cued conceptually using the instructions. The data were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel regression. Learners categorized the continuum in a similar manner when they believed they were hearing English. However, when they believed they were hearing Spanish, “voiceless” responses increased as a function of L2 proficiency. This research demonstrates the double phonemic boundary effect can be conceptually cued in LBs and supports accounts positing selective activation of independent perception grammars in L2 learning.\n\n\n\n\n@Article{casillas_dpbe_l2_2020,\n  author = {Cristina Lozano-Arg&uuml;elles and Laura Fern&aacute;ndez Arroyo and Nicole Rodr&iacute;guez and Ezequiel Durand and Juan Jos&eacute; Garrido Pozu and Jennifer Markovits Rojas and Jessica Varela and N&uacute;ria {de Rocafiguera} and Joseph Vicent Casillas},\n  title = {Conceptually cued perceptual categorization in adult {L}2 learners},\n  year = {2021},\n  volume = {43},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {204-219},\n  journal = {Studies in Second Language Acquisition},\n  doi = {https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263120000273},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasillas, J.

The aim was to analyze the longitudinal development of Spanish stop voicing contrasts in an immersion learning context. Native English‐speaking late learners of Spanish provided production data for Spanish stops on a weekly basis throughout a domestic immersion program. The data were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel models and generalized additive mixed models. The analyses revealed phonetic learning in voiced stops over the course of the immersion program, though learners’ production was inconsistent and did not fall within native ranges for most stop segments. The results suggest that L2 phonetic category formation can occur at an early stage of development and follows a nonlinear trajectory that is subject to individual and segment‐specific variability. Furthermore, L2 phonetic representations are unstable during the early stages of learning.\n\n\n\n\n@Article{CasillasProdStops_ll2020,\n  author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas},\n  title = {The longitudinal development of fine-phonetic detail: \n    {S}top production in a domestic immersion program},\n  year = {2020},\n  journal = {Language Learning},\n  doi = {https://doi.org/10.1111/lang.12392},\n  volume = {70},\n  number = {3},\n  pages = {768--806},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLozano-Argüelles, C., N.

Moreover, anticipatory studies with non-native speakers are scarce and mix proficiency with anticipatory experience. To address these limitations, we investigated whether Spanish monolinguals and advanced English learners of Spanish use suprasegmentals (stress: oxytone, paroxytone) and segmentals (syllabic structure: CVC, CV) to predict word suffixes, and whether increased anticipatory experience acquired via interpreting will facilitate anticipation in non-interpreting L2 situations. Eye-tracking data revealed that: (1) the three groups made use of the linguistic variables, and L2 groups did not anticipate in CV paroxytones; (2) everybody anticipated better with the less frequent conditions (oxytones, CVC) having fewer lexical competitors; (3) monolinguals anticipated earlier than L2 learners; and (4) interpreters anticipated at a faster rate in some conditions. These findings indicate that less frequent suprasegmental and segmental information and anticipatory experience facilitate native and non-native spoken word prediction.\n\n\n\n\n@Article{SagarraLozanoCasillas_blc2019,\n  author = {Cristina Lozano-Arg&uuml;elles and Nuria Sagarra and Joseph Vincent Casillas},\n  title = {Slowly but surely: {I}nterpreting facilitates {L}2 morphological \n    anticipation based on suprasegmental and segmental information},\n  year = {2020},\n  volume = {23},\n  number = {4},\n  pages = {752-762},\n  journal = {Bilingualism: Language and Cognition},\n  doi = {https://doi.org/10.1017/S1366728919000634},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasillas, J.

This study focuses on the role of language use during the initial stages of development of phonetic categories related to stop voicing and analyzes the relationship between production and perception. Native English-speaking late learners of Spanish provided production/perception data on a weekly basis throughout the course of a seven-week immersion program in which L1 use was prohibited. The production/perception data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed effects models. Generalized additive mixed models were used to analyze and compare the learning trajectories of each modality. The analyses revealed phonetic learning in both production and perception over the course of the program. Perception gains paralleled those of native bilinguals by the conclusion of the program and preceded production gains. This study is novel in that it provides production/perception data in a semi-longitudinal design. Moreover, the beginning adult learners are examined in a learning context in which L1 use was minimal and L2 input was maximized. Taken together, the experiments suggest that L2 phonetic category formation can occur abruptly, at an early stage of development, is perceptually driven, and appears to be particularly fragile during the initial stages of learning.\n\n\n\n\n@Article{CasillasProdPercStops,\n  author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas},\n  title = {Phonetic category formation is perceptually driven during the \n    early stages of adult {L}2 development},\n  journal = {Language and Speech},\n  year = {2020},\n  doi = {https://doi.org/10.1177/0023830919866225},\n  volume = {63},\n  number = {3},\n  pages = {550--581},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasillas, J.

Specifically, the study analyzed the development of Spanish stop voicing in an immersion learning context in which L1 use was minimal and L2 input was maximized. Native English speaking learners of Spanish and bilinguals provided production data that were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel models. The analyses included a pre/post program evaluation of stop voicing in a delayed shadowing task, as well as a comparison with the participants’ post-program production in a task that required semantic processing. The analyses revealed phonetic learning for stop voicing over the course of the program, though production gains diminished when the task required semantic processing. The results suggest L2 phonetic category formation can occur at an early stage of development, but L2 phonetic representations are unstable during initial stages of learning.\n\n\n\n\n@InProceedings{CasillasICPhS2019article,\n  author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas},\n  editor = {Sasha Calhoun and Paola Escudero and Marija Tabain and {aul Warren}},\n  organization = {In Proceedings of the 19th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences},\n  publisher = {Melbourne, Australia 2019 (ISBN: 978-0-646-80069-1)},\n  title = {Semantic processing triggers cross-linguistic interference during early phonetic category development},\n  booktitle = {ICPhS 19},\n  pages = {3348-3352},\n  year = {2019},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasillas, J.

In Experiment 1, simultaneous Spanish-English bilinguals and beginner second-language learners of Spanish labeled the same acoustic continuum in two experimental sessions (Spanish mode, English mode), and both groups were found to display language-specific perceptual boundaries (or session effects). In Experiment 2, early bilinguals and late second-language learners of various levels of proficiency participated in a single session in which, in random order, they labeled nonwords that were designed to prime either Spanish or English language modes. Early bilinguals and relatively proficient second-language learners, but not less proficient learners, displayed mode-specific perceptual normalization criteria even in conditions of rapid, random mode switching. Along with similar ones, the experiments reported here demonstrate that bilinguals are able to exploit language-specific perceptual processes (or norms) when processing speech sounds, which entails some degree of separation between their sound systems.\n\n\n\n\n@Article{CasillasSimonet_jphon2018,\n  author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas and Miquel Simonet},\n  journal = {Journal of Phonetics},\n  title = {{Perceptual categorization and bilingual language modes: \n    Assessing the double phonemic boundary in early and late bilinguals}},\n  volume = {71},\n  year = {2018},\n  pages = {51--64},\n  doi = {https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wocn.2018.07.002},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSagarra, N. and J.

Our findings show that the monolinguals used prosodic information to predict word endings in both tasks, regardless of first-syllable stress (stressed, unstressed) and structure (CV, CVC). In contrast, the beginning learners did not use prosodic information to anticipate word suffixes in any task or condition. Importantly, the advanced learners mirrored the monolinguals, except in words with first-syllable CV structure, but were slower than the monolinguals. Finally, WM was not associated with anticipatory eye movements, though results were inconclusive for offline processing. Taken together, the present study shows that suprasegmental information facilitates morphological anticipation during spoken word recognition, and that adult learners can gain anticipatory processing patterns qualitatively, but not quantitatively, similar to monolinguals.\n\n\n\n\n@Article{SagarraCasillas_JSLS2018,\n  author = {Nuria Sagarra and Joseph Vincent Casillas},\n  journal = {Journal of Second Language Studies},\n  title = {Suprasegmental information cues morphological anticipation during \n    {L1/L2} lexical access},\n  volume = {1},\n  number = {1},\n  year = {2018},\n  pages = {31--59},\n  doi = {https://doi.org/10.1075/jsls.17026.sag},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBessett, R.

When unambiguous stimuli are used instead, selective adaptation (SA) effects have been reported, even after few adaptor presentations. Crucially, selective adaptation by an ambiguous sound in biasing lexical contexts had previously been found only after massive adaptor repetition [Samuel (2001). Psychol. Sci. 12(4), 348–351]. The present study shows that extensive exposure is not necessary for lexically driven selective adaptation to occur. Lexically driven selective adaptation can arise after as few as nine adaptor presentations. Additionally, build-up course inspection reveals several parallelisms with the time course observed for SA with unambiguous stimuli.\n\n\n\n\n@Article{LlmopartCasillasJASAEL2016,\n  author = {Miquel Llompart and Joseph Vincent Casillas},\n  title = {Lexically driven selective adaptation by ambiguous auditory \n    stimuli occurs after limited exposure to adaptors},\n  journal = {Journal of the Acoustical Society of America},\n  volume = {139},\n  number = {5},\n  pages = {EL172--EL177},\n  year = {2016},\n  doi = {https://doi.org/10.1121/1.4951704},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasillas, J.

The participants provided data in three tasks: one production and two perceptual. The study finds that both learner groups differ from native controls in their production and perception of the /æ/–/ɑ/ contrast.

The first experiment revealed that the early learners produced the contrast in a native-like manner in terms of the spectral envelope and duration use.

English and Spanish coronal stops are hypothesized to differ in terms of voice-onset time and place of articulation. We are particularly concerned with capturing the place of articulation difference with acoustic data, as the voice-onset time difference is well known. Specifically, we focus on English /d/ and Spanish /t/, which are phonetically-voiceless stops with a short-lag voice-onset time. Spanish /t/ has been described as being articulated at dental place, whereas English /d/ is articulated at alveolar place. Mixed-effects models explored various spectral measurements of the consonant burst and found that standard deviation, relative burst intensity, and center of gravity differed as a function of place of articulation (or language).\n\n\n\n\n@InProceedings{CasillasDiazSimonetICPhS2015article,\n  author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas and Yamile D&iacute;az and Miquel Simonet},\n  editor = {The Scottish Consortium {for ICPhS 2015}},\n  organization = {Proceedings of the 18th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences},\n  publisher = {University of Glasgow: Glasgow. http://www.icphs2015.info, \n    ISSN: 241-0669},\n  title = {Acoustics of Spanish and English coronal stops},\n  booktitle = {ICPhS 18},\n  pages = {1-5},\n  year = {2015},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimonet, M., J.
