DOI:\nhttps://doi.org/10.3390/languages6010009.\n\n\n\n( Link |\nAbstract |\nBib )\n\n\nPrevious studies attest that some early bilinguals produce the sounds of their languages in a manner that is characterized as “compromise” with regard to monolingual speakers. The present study uses meta-analytic techniques and coronal stop data from early bilinguals in order to assess this claim. The goal was to evaluate the cumulative evidence for “compromise” voice-onset time (VOT) in the speech of early bilinguals by providing a comprehensive assessment of the literature and presenting an acoustic analysis of coronal stops from early Spanish–English bilinguals. The studies were coded for linguistic and methodological features, as well as effect sizes, and then analyzed using a cross-classified Bayesian meta-analysis. The pooled effect for “compromise” VOT was negligible (β = −0.13). The acoustic analysis of the coronal stop data showed that the early Spanish–English bilinguals often produced Spanish and English targets with mismatched features from their other language. These performance mismatches presumably occurred as a result of interlingual interactions elicited by the experimental task. Taken together, the results suggest that early bilinguals do not have “compromise” VOT, though their speech involves dynamic phonetic interactions that can surface as performance mismatches during speech production.\n\n\n\n\n@Article{casillas_perfomance_mismatches_2021,\n  author = {Joseph Vicent Casillas},\n  title = {Interlingual Interactions Elicit Performance Mismatches Not \n    {'Compromise'} Categories in Early Bilinguals: {E}vidence from Meta-Analysis \n    and Coronal Stops},\n  year = {2021},\n  journal = {Languages},\n  volume = {6},\n  number = {9},\n  pages = {1--20},\n  doi = {https://doi.org/10.3390/languages6010009},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLozano-Argüelles, C., L.

Following Gonzales et al. (2019), we replicate the double phonemic boundary effect in late learners (LBs) using conceptual-based cueing. We administered a forced choice identification task to 169 native English adult learners of Spanish in two sessions. In both sessions, participants identified the same /b/-/p/ voicing continuum, but language context was cued conceptually using the instructions. The data were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel regression. Learners categorized the continuum in a similar manner when they believed they were hearing English. However, when they believed they were hearing Spanish, “voiceless” responses increased as a function of L2 proficiency. This research demonstrates the double phonemic boundary effect can be conceptually cued in LBs and supports accounts positing selective activation of independent perception grammars in L2 learning.\n\n\n\n\n@Article{casillas_dpbe_l2_2020,\n  author = {Cristina Lozano-Arg&uuml;elles and Laura Fern&aacute;ndez Arroyo and Nicole Rodr&iacute;guez and Ezequiel Durand and Juan Jos&eacute; Garrido Pozu and Jennifer Markovits Rojas and Jessica Varela and N&uacute;ria {de Rocafiguera} and Joseph Vicent Casillas},\n  title = {Conceptually cued perceptual categorization in adult {L}2 learners},\n  year = {2021},\n  volume = {43},\n  number = {1},\n  pages = {204-219},\n  journal = {Studies in Second Language Acquisition},\n  doi = {https://doi.org/10.1017/S0272263120000273},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasillas, J.

The aim was to analyze the longitudinal development of Spanish stop voicing contrasts in an immersion learning context. Native English‐speaking late learners of Spanish provided production data for Spanish stops on a weekly basis throughout a domestic immersion program. The data were analyzed using Bayesian multilevel models and generalized additive mixed models. The analyses revealed phonetic learning in voiced stops over the course of the immersion program, though learners’ production was inconsistent and did not fall within native ranges for most stop segments. The results suggest that L2 phonetic category formation can occur at an early stage of development and follows a nonlinear trajectory that is subject to individual and segment‐specific variability. Furthermore, L2 phonetic representations are unstable during the early stages of learning.\n\n\n\n\n@Article{CasillasProdStops_ll2020,\n  author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas},\n  title = {The longitudinal development of fine-phonetic detail: \n    {S}top production in a domestic immersion program},\n  year = {2020},\n  journal = {Language Learning},\n  doi = {https://doi.org/10.1111/lang.12392},\n  volume = {70},\n  number = {3},\n  pages = {768--806},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLozano-Argüelles, C., N.

DOI:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1017/S1366728919000634.\n\n\n\n( Link |\nAbstract |\nBib )\n\n\nNative speakers use suprasegmental information to predict words, but less is known about segmental information. Moreover, anticipatory studies with non-native speakers are scarce and mix proficiency with anticipatory experience. To address these limitations, we investigated whether Spanish monolinguals and advanced English learners of Spanish use suprasegmentals (stress: oxytone, paroxytone) and segmentals (syllabic structure: CVC, CV) to predict word suffixes, and whether increased anticipatory experience acquired via interpreting will facilitate anticipation in non-interpreting L2 situations. Eye-tracking data revealed that: (1) the three groups made use of the linguistic variables, and L2 groups did not anticipate in CV paroxytones; (2) everybody anticipated better with the less frequent conditions (oxytones, CVC) having fewer lexical competitors; (3) monolinguals anticipated earlier than L2 learners; and (4) interpreters anticipated at a faster rate in some conditions.

This study focuses on the role of language use during the initial stages of development of phonetic categories related to stop voicing and analyzes the relationship between production and perception. Native English-speaking late learners of Spanish provided production/perception data on a weekly basis throughout the course of a seven-week immersion program in which L1 use was prohibited. The production/perception data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed effects models. Generalized additive mixed models were used to analyze and compare the learning trajectories of each modality. The analyses revealed phonetic learning in both production and perception over the course of the program. Perception gains paralleled those of native bilinguals by the conclusion of the program and preceded production gains. This study is novel in that it provides production/perception data in a semi-longitudinal design. Moreover, the beginning adult learners are examined in a learning context in which L1 use was minimal and L2 input was maximized. Taken together, the experiments suggest that L2 phonetic category formation can occur abruptly, at an early stage of development, is perceptually driven, and appears to be particularly fragile during the initial stages of learning.\n\n\n\n\n@Article{CasillasProdPercStops,\n  author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas},\n  title = {Phonetic category formation is perceptually driven during the \n    early stages of adult {L}2 development},\n  journal = {Language and Speech},\n  year = {2020},\n  doi = {https://doi.org/10.1177/0023830919866225},\n  volume = {63},\n  number = {3},\n  pages = {550--581},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasillas, J.

The\nanalyses included a pre/post program evaluation of stop voicing in a delayed\nshadowing task, as well as a comparison with the participants’ post-program\nproduction in a task that required semantic processing. The analyses revealed\nphonetic learning for stop voicing over the course of the program, though\nproduction gains diminished when the task required semantic processing.

Our\nfindings show that the monolinguals used prosodic information to predict word\nendings in both tasks, regardless of first-syllable stress (stressed,\nunstressed) and structure (CV, CVC). In contrast, the beginning learners did\nnot use prosodic information to anticipate word suffixes in any task or\ncondition. Importantly, the advanced learners mirrored the monolinguals, except\nin words with first-syllable CV structure, but were slower than the\nmonolinguals. Finally, WM was not associated with anticipatory eye movements,\nthough results were inconclusive for offline processing.
