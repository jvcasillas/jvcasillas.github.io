You can find more information here: https://RAP-group.github.io. My\nmain interests are in phonetics, laboratory phonology, and second\nlanguage acquisition. A principle aim of my research is to better\nunderstand the relationship between language use and sound\nrepresentation in the mind, as well as the structure of sound systems in\nhuman languages. Most of my research is conducted on bilinguals of\nvarying proficiency and linguistic experience. Feel free to explore the\ntabs on this page if you are interested in knowing more about my\nresearch projects.\n\nProjects\nCurrent projects\nLongitudinal development of fine-phonetic detail in late\nlearners\n(Info)\n\n\nThis ongoing project explores L2 category formation and the relationship\nbetween speech production and speech perception during the early stages\nof L2 acquisition. The data were/are collected in a stateside immersion\nprogram over the course of a summer. The participants complete a variety\nof tasks aimed at analyzing their acquisition of various L2 segments,\nsuch as: stops, trills, laterals and vowels.\n\n\nLanguage-specific perceptual normalization in adult L2\nacquisition\n(Info)\n\n\nThis project explores a long history of ‘language set’ experiments with\nthe goal of furthering our understanding of how bilinguals deal with the\nlack of invariance in the speech signal, both between and within\nlanguages. The project has implications for category formation and the\ndevelopment of bilingual language modes. (with Miquel Simonet)\n\n\nProduction/perception of English/Spanish coronal\nstops\n(Info)\n\n\nThis project has explored the acoustic characteristics of coronal stops\nin Spanish and English (link),\nthe effects of stress on VOT in the Spanish/English monolinguals and\nbilinguals (link),\nas well as acoustic evidence for language-specific places of\narticulation (in preparation).

Casillas “Literal is not always easier:\nLiteral and default translation, post-editing effort, and comparable\ncorpora”. In: Translation, Cognition & Behavior.\n\nRecent Publications\n\nCasillas, J. V. (2021). “Interlingual Interactions Elicit Performance\nMismatches Not ‘Compromise’ Categories in Early Bilinguals: Evidence\nfrom Meta-Analysis and Coronal Stops”. In: Languages 6.9,\npp. 1-20. DOI: https://doi.org/10.3390/languages6010009.\n\n\n\n(\nLink |\nAbstract\n|\nBib\n)\n\n\nPrevious studies attest that some early bilinguals produce the sounds of\ntheir languages in a manner that is characterized as “compromise” with\nregard to monolingual speakers. The present study uses meta-analytic\ntechniques and coronal stop data from early bilinguals in order to\nassess this claim. The goal was to evaluate the cumulative evidence for\n“compromise” voice-onset time (VOT) in the speech of early bilinguals by\nproviding a comprehensive assessment of the literature and presenting an\nacoustic analysis of coronal stops from early Spanish–English\nbilinguals. The studies were coded for linguistic and methodological\nfeatures, as well as effect sizes, and then analyzed using a\ncross-classified Bayesian meta-analysis. The pooled effect for\n“compromise” VOT was negligible (β = −0.13). The acoustic analysis of\nthe coronal stop data showed that the early Spanish–English bilinguals\noften produced Spanish and English targets with mismatched features from\ntheir other language. These performance mismatches presumably occurred\nas a result of interlingual interactions elicited by the experimental\ntask.

Un cuestionario basado en\nlos índices de credibilidad utilizados por McCroskey (1999) se\ndistribuyó a 111 participantes para medir sus actitudes hacia los 4\ncandidatos. El experimento consistió en una variación de la técnica\nmatched-guise para asignar a los participantes a uno de dos grupos, el\nprimero escuchó la variante estándar y el segundo la variante fricativa.\nSe demuestra que la variante fricativa recibe valoraciones de\ncredibilidad más bajas que la variante estándar.\n\n\n\n\n@InProceedings{CasillasWSS62013article,\n  author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas},\n  editor = {Ana M.

Partiendo de las investigaciones de\nCedergren (1973), Brown (1989) y Herrera (2006), el presente estudio\nanaliza la fricativización del fonema /ʧ/ en el español de las mujeres\ndel sur de Arizona. El uso de una regresión de subida y bajada de\nGoldvarb X determinó que la edad de las participantes, el contexto\nposterior a /ʧ/ y el lugar de nacimiento son factores determinantes para\nla realización de la variante fricativa.\n\n\n\n\n@Article{Casillas2012divergencias,\n  author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas},\n  journal = {Divergencias: Revista de estudios ling&uuml;&iacute;sticos y literarios},\n  number = {1},\n  title = {La fricativizaci&oacute;n del africado /t&#643;/ en el habla de las mujeres del sur de {A}rizona},\n  volume = {10},\n  pages = {56-70},\n  year = {2012},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasillas, J.

El refrán ha tenido y sigue teniendo suma\nimportancia a la hora de conocer y entender la cultura hispana, ya sea\noral o en textos escritos. Es algo que los estudiantes de español como\nsegunda lengua pueden comprobar puesto que supone un reto en su\naprendizaje. Como es bien sabido, El Quijote, novela estudiada\nexhaustivamente desde que fue publicada por primera vez, es una fuente\nparemiológica imprescindible para quien quiera aprender, investigar o\nsimplemente gozar del refranero cervantino. En palabras de Tarnovska:\n“No hay otra obra literaria que sea ni pueda ser considerada refranero\npopular de la misma importancia que El Quijote” (287). Además de ser una\nde las obras de literatura más esenciales de todos los tiempos, también\nes un recurso, una vía por medio de la cual el lector puede acercarse a\nla cultura española.\n\n\n\n\n@Article{Casillas2009gaceta,\n  author = {Joseph Vincent Casillas},\n  issn = {1886-1741},\n  journal = {La Gaceta Hisp&aacute;nica de Madrid},\n  title = {El uso de los refranes en El Quijote},\n  volume = {VIII},\n  year = {2009},\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nSubmitted\n\nCoretta, S., J.
