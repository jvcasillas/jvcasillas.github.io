This repository is a collection of snippets that I use in [SublimeText][SublimeText] for doing statistical analysis in [R][R]. 
The goal is straightforward: document the code that I use most often while doing linguistic research and make it readily available (and understandable) to other linguists. 
If you are interested in helping see the github [repository](https://github.com/jvcasillas/R-snippets). 
To install R-snippets see the [package control][package control R-snippets] page. 
To use a snippet, type the trigger and hit the tab key. 
For example, typing <code>lm</code> brings up the following window:  

```{r, shiny-bivariate-reg, echo=F, fig.retina=2, fig.align='center', out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("featured.png")
```

Selecting ```Random slope and random intercept model``` expands to...

```r
# load lme4 for mixed models
library(lme4)

# random intercept and random slope model
modelName = lmer(DV ~ fixedFactor1 +* fixedFactor2 + (1 + randomSlope|randomInt), data=df)
modelName

hist(residuals(modelName))
qqnorm(residuals(modelName))
qqline(residuals(modelName))
```

Main triggers:  

- "plot": templates for plotting in base R
- "edit": options useful for data cleansing and saving
- "desc": descriptive statistics of data
- "ttest": distinct types of t-test
- "aov": distinct analysis of variance models
- "lm": linear and logistic regression
- "lmem": linear mixed effects models

Extras:  

- "subset": make subsets of a DF
- "read": read/load/install data/packages into R
- "save": save plots, dfs, tables, etc.
- "tikz": template for creating R plots in LaTeX
