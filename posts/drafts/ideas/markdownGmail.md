# Markdown in Gmail

## Overview

You can write an email in **markdown**. It is easy. Follow these steps:

1. Download the plugin [here](http://markdown-here.com).
2. Install the **plugin**.
3. Use markdown.

## Examples

- Here are some examples of how it works.
- You can copy and paste this into your email client.

### Code

To write in code, use three ticks followed by the language. Then insert your code and close the coding using three more ticks.

```r
2 + 2
mod <- lm(dv ~ iv, data = df)

# plot
with(df, plot(dv ~ iv))
```

### Tables

You can also make pretty tables. 

| Header | For | each | column |
|:-------|:---:|-----:|:-------|
| things | go  | here | !!!!   | 
| things | go  | here | !!!!   |
| things | go  | here | !!!!   |
| things | go  | here | !!!!   |
| things | go  | here | !!!!   |

### Equations

These don't seem to work for me. 

$\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}$

---

That's it!
