#### HTML5 slides

I recently learned how to create HTML5 slides using __.Rmd__ files and __pandoc__. [Click here][Click here] to check out an example. I will be posting a tutorial on how to do this in the near future (I hope).

**Update 2** This process has been streamlined in the newest update to RStudio ([check it out here][check it out here]). The results are quite impressive ([Ex. 1][Ex. 1], [Ex. 2][Ex. 2])
