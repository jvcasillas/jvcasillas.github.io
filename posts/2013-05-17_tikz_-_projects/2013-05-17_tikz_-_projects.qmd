#### Overview

This mini tutorial is part II about incorporating `tikzDevice` into your workflow. 
It explains the file structure necessary to successfully include `tikzDevice` plots into your $\LaTeX$ document. 
You must first have `tikzDevice` installed. 
If you don't, see [part I][part I] for more information.

#### The structure

A simple yet effective way to do reproducible research is to use [R][R] (for statistical analysis) directly in a $\LaTeX$ environment. 
There are two ways to accomplish this: (1) Sweave and (2) [knitr][knitr]. 
`knitr` seems to be the better choice, as it builds on some of the deficiencies of Sweave, and is what I am currently using in my workflow. 
In order to successfully "knit" R code into a .tex format we must use a no-web (.nw) file to create the .tex file. 
There are two types of no-web files: .Rnw and .Snw. 
I am not completely sure what the differences are between then, but I use .Rnw and that is what I will mention in this tutorial.

The first step is to create a project folder. 
For the purposes of this tutorial let's call this folder "master". 
Next, we will need some data and some R code that analyzes it. 
The most common, no-hassle way to accomplish this in R is to save your R code in a separate .R file. 
For this tutorial, we will call our data "my-data.txt" and our R code "example.R". 
The fake data we are going to analyze is for a two-alternative forced choice identification experiment. 
So, our fake data is in the "my-data.txt" file and the R code that analyzes it is in the example.R file.

The next step is to create the "no web" .Rnw file. 
This is as simple as creating a document in your text editor of choice (I use [TextMate 2][tm2] and [Sublime Text 3][st3]) and saving it with a .Rnw extension. 
For this tutorial we will call this file "example.Rnw". 
Its purpose is to call the R code written in "example.R" (which uses the fake data in "my-data.txt") in order to produce a .tex file (in this case "example.tex"). 
Still with me? Good.

Next we need to prepare where we are going to keep the plots produced by tikzDevice. 
I find it most convenient to have a specific folder, "plots\_folder", where I only keep the tikzDevice plots. 
So, create this folder inside the "master" folder. 
`tikzDevice` creates the R plots and converts them to a $\LaTeX$ format (the benefits of this are further explained in part III of this tutorial), saves them in "plots\_folder" and we will then include them in the example.tex file which can be compiled into a PDF. 
The image below shows what this should look like when it's all said and done.

```{r, workflow-ex, echo=F, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("./assets/img/tikz_workflow.png")
```
